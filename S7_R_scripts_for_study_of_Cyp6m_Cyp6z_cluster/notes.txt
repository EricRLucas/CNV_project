Analysis of CNVs in the CYP6M-CYP6Z cluster was performed by running the script shrink_CNV_for_CYPM2-Z1.r followed by CYP6M2-Z1_analysis_shrunk_data.r.

The file loaded by shrink_CNV_for_CYP6M2-Z1.r is the output of the script CNV_analysis_alt.r (provided in the folder R_scripts_for_detecting_CNVs) run from chromosome 3R.

The discordant reads and breakpoint reads used in these scripts are generated by SSFA_v3.py and breakpoint_detector.py, both provided in the folder python_script_for_handling_bam_files.

The proportion of reads aligning with mapq = 0 (mapq_proportions_allchrom.txt) was calculated using the script get_prop_mapq0.py, provided in the folder python_scripts_for_handling_bam_files.

A CNV vcf file was prepared for mvncall with the script make_CYP6Z1-M2_CNV_vcf.r.
